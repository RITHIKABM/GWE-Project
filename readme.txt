Export Merchandise Automation System

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

The project “EXPORT MERCHANDISE AUTOMATION SYSTEM” is a web application. This project is mainly used to maintain all the garments related activities in 
online. It is very easy to place order of the product. Admin post the information about the 
product and interested customer can register their details in the application.
 At present, all the garment related activities have been carried out mostly by 
manually. Online Ordering System greatly implies the ordering process for both the 
customer and the branch. Customer can choose one or more items to place an order which 
will land in the Cart. Customer can view all the order details in the cart before checking out. 
At the end, customer gets order confirmation details. Once the order is placed it is entered 
in the database and retrieved in real time. This allow branch manager to quickly go through 
the orders as they are received and process all orders efficiently and with minimal delays 
and confusion. Once the Order is delivered to customer can provide the review to the branch.
 The customer can login to the website after proper registration using the 
customer id and the password. The unregistered users of the website can just view the 
website of the garments but does not have the permission to order for the product, up to date 
stock details are also maintained.

OBJECTIVE:
 The goal of the project is to create a web application that will reduce the amount 
of manual effort involved in managing orders, products, payments, and service. It keeps all 
information related to orders, products, and customers. This project is entirely Administrator. 
Only registered users have access to their accounts, which they may use to order products, 
make payments, and add items to their carts. It keeps track of all payment, billing, and 
customer information.
